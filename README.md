## Introduction:

This project's main goal is to show off all the cool things you can do with the Official [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/). This project will use Node.js as a framework to create a simple RESTful API whose endpoints will plug into Notion's [API References](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro). Any feedback is welcomed, you can view a thorough walkthrough and tutorial on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHVRUE0xfE_HejIQp7DALlw)

## About:

This is a simple repositories to show how easy it is to setup a Node Backend Server to manage your Notion directly. You can call different Notion API References and Integrate it directly into your projects! Anything done with Node can also be done with Dino.js and Nest.js! 

In this tutorial we will cover the basics of using Notion, how to setup an Integration, and how to properly using their API References to create pgases, manage databases and tables, and fetch your data to display on your own sites!

## Setup

``` 
npm install
npm start
```
